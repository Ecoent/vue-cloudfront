Vue Cloudfront is a standalone PWA cloudfront, mainly for self-hosting purposes. Currently the only backend-solution is the official [vue-cloudfront-api](https://github.com/Simonwep/vue-cloudfront-api) which is a full-featured RESTful api. This project is and will always be open source, anybody can contribute to it - it should, and hopefully will be, a massive improvement regarding to cloud solutions in contrast to google-drive and drop-box. The project is currently in **alpha** phase.

For anyone who want some guidance, feel free to contact me on discord `Simon#6765` :)
